## Revamp

I've wanted to make an overhaul of my old portfolio site for a while now.
I've gained a lot of experience with React and front-end since then, so I thought, why not rebuild my site from the ground up? Enjoy!

## Usage

Navigate to the root of the project, and run

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment to cPanel

Run the command

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a directory in your project called **dist**.

This new directory contains a compressed version of your React app in static files, this is what you will deploy to your cPanel File Manager.
You can then zip and upload this directory to your public_html folder, and unzip its contents.
